* `sandbox` - I'll add additional demos into the sandbox as we go.
* `csharp-prep` - I may put my own code into these C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - I may put some code into these preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - I probably won't put my own code here, but I may offer some example UML diagrams.
